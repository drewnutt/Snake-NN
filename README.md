## Snake Game played by a Neural Network trained using a genetic algorithm.

#### The Neural Network gets 5 inputs as follows:
  1. Presence of object above the snake's head (1 or 0)
  2. Presence of object below the snake's head (1 or 0)
  3. Presence of object left of the snake's head (1 or 0)
  4. Presence of object right of the snake's head  (1 or 0)
  5. Angle from the snakes head to the food  (-1 to 1)
#### Neural Network outputs a direction for the snake to move
